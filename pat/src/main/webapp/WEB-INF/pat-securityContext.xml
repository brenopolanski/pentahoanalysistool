		Quick development note.
		
		Before activating this context extension, one might wish to add a mechanism to catch
		security violations exceptions. GWT RPC calls do not support security exceptions as
		of now, so here's a little snippet that can be of much help.
		
		If JSP form is the authentication way, you need to add this code.
		
			var invalidSession = function(){ window.location = '<%= request.getContextPath() %>/org.pentaho.pat.Pat/login.jsp'; };
			Ext.lib.Ajax.on('status:403', invalidSession );
			
		Just add this to your client side code and it should redirect all HTTP forbidden errors
		to the login page.

		Any bean invocations that have the @Secured annotation added will
		be validated before executed. -->
