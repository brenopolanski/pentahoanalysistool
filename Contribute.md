# PAT needs you!! #

We are always looking for people who are willing to help us. We do need every helping hand!
Now this contribution could be anything like:

  * Coding - New Features/Code Cleanup/Bug Fixing
  * CSS Layouting - Make PAT look cool
  * Designing a nice Icon Set - Ask on mailing list and irc for more details
  * Designing a PAT logo - We need something distinctive
  * Documenting - We have a couple of documents in our repo that need padding out and turning into a definitive manual(http://ci.analytical-labs.com/job/CI-End-User-Docs/)
  * Testing - Find out whats broken and file bugs on jira
  * Maintaining the translations
  * Sort out Analytical Labs website - We need the website looking shit hot, and minus the stupid spam, volunteers please(I hate webdev)
  * Create PAT Admin Console - The Console needs to manage users, roles and database connections for the PAT server
  * Setup TRAC ticket system - We are planning to move to our internal repository, ticketing and tracking system, this needs setting up properly.
  * Create server backup procedure to our backup facility - When we move to our own servers we need nightly backups.



**Of course you can always contribute financially and help us cover infrastructure expenses, travel expenses for PAT hackfests, or just pay for the implementation of your favourite feature request :-)**
