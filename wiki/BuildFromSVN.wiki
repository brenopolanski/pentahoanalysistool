= Introduction =
You can easily build PAT from source by following two steps.


* 1. SVN Checkout *

Checkout the project with your favourite SVN client from:
{{{
http://pentahoanalysistool.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pat/
}}}

* 2. Maven Build *

Run Maven or Maven Eclipse Plugin (check HOWTO at http://smartgwt.rorschach.de/index.php5/Setting_up_Eclipse_%26_Maven2) with following goals

*RUN*

{{{
com.totsp.gwt:maven-googlewebtoolkit2-plugin:gwt
}}}
Runs the application


*PACKAGE*

{{{
clean package
}}}

Cleans and then packages the application into a WAR file, which you
can deploy easily by dropping it into tomcat/webapps e.g

= Known Problems with Eclipse building =

There are reports that GWT-DEV files are extracted in a new directory (e.g. PROJECT_HOME/{local.Repository}/com/google/gwt/gwt-dev/1.5.3) instead of the local maven repository (default: ~/.m2/repository/com/google/gwt/gwt-dev/1.5.3) during the build process.

This is (probably) caused by the maven-eclipse plugin. This can be solved due the use of an external maven installation (Change that in Eclipse Preferences : Maven : Installation - Add)
