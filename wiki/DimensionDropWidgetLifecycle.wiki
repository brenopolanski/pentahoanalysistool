#summary The lifecycle of dimension drops

= Introduction =

Just a quick lifecycle indicating the dimension drag and dropping process(on to the Olap Table Canvas).


= Initial Setup =

 *Dimension List in East/West Panel
 *3 Dimension Drop areas on the canvas Rows/Cols/Filter

= Usage = 
 * User drags a dimension label from the dimension panel on to the Olap Table canvas
 * If dropped on the dimension drop area then add new label to area and expand height or width by 1 cell
 * Once dropped select the top/all level for the query model
 * If dropped elsewhere then notify user and do nothing
 * Allow dragging back off the canvas to the axis in the dimension panel to aid dimension removal.
