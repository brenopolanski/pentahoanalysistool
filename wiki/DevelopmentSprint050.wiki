The following describes the action plan and planned new features for this development sprint.

== Action Plan ==
  * consistent pat license
  * make mockups of everything we need 
  * make list of needed widgets 
  * updated lifecycle (including needed backend methods)
  * check if we can/should use xul
  * follow rules for cleaning / re-using existing widgets 
  * follow coding guidelines

== Rules for GUI Code ==
  * move pat.client > pat.client.deprecated
  * create new i18n classes / properties [getResourceByKey("pat.client.mdx")]
  * choose widget/panels we still need
    * check for coding guideline
    * check if code looks clean
    * check comments
    * check if widget css tagged properly
    * check for warnings and remove them
    * switch to new i18n method
    * XUL'ify if thats the decision

== Details for 0.5.0 ==

=== GUI Design ===
  * like jakes mockup until page 10
  * no menubar
  * button bar: new connection, manage connections, new QM query, new mdx query, quick new query, help
  * filter drop target
  * member selection like on slide 18
  * execute query button for execution
  * dimension stack panel right/left as user preference
  * new mdx editor

=== Lifecycle ===
*create new connection*
  * wizard pops up
  * choose jdbc mondrian / xmla
  * enter details (paste schema or upload)
  * save & close / next
  * if next:
    * choose QM / mdx query
    * if QM query:
      * get cubes all connected connections (expand the one from the new connection)
    * create new query tab

*manage connections*
  * opens up connection list popup
    * delete connection
    * add connection > create new connection workflow > back to connection list
    * modify connection > opens up connection details (show schema / change and save it or upload new schema)
    * save connection
    * back to connection list popup


*new QM query*
  * opens up cubemenu (treelist with connections as parent nodes)
  * select cube
  * new query tab opens

*new mdx query*
  * opens up connection list
  * select connection
  * new mdx query tab opens
	
*quick new query*
  * dropdownlist with connections/cubes
  * if connection selected > button new mdx query is enabled
  * if cube selected > new QM query / new mdx query is enabled
  * on button click > new query tab


*new querying workflow*
	new QM query:
	QM query tab opens up
	its possible to move dimensions in the dimensionpanel from UNUSED to COLUMNS / ROWS / FILTER axis
			COLUMNS
				+ Dim1
			ROWS
			FILTER
			UNUSED
				+ Dim2
				+ Dim3
				+ Measures
	
	other way to change selection is to drag the dimensions to the canvas to the COLUMNS / ROWS / FILTER drop targets
	when dropped its possible to include members with the dimension browser
	execute query
	
	change QM query:
	in the dim panel click on dimension and select "browse dimension for selection" / click on "Edit" mode > canvas transforms back to the state before the first query execution, click on dimension and choose "browse dimension for selection"
	opens up dimension browser 
	change selection
	close dimension browser
	execute query
	
	new / change MDX query:
	mdx query tab opens up
	on the top of the query panel mdx editor area
	below table
