#How to build pentaho analysis tool

= Introduction =

The project is maven based. Either the maven plug in for eclipse or the stand alone can be used to build it

The build goal is: 

com.totsp.gwt:maven-googlewebtoolkit2-plugin:gwt

From the command line run 
mvn com.totsp.gwt:maven-googlewebtoolkit2-plugin:gwt 
in the project directory to build and run the application.

The first time you do this it will download a lot of dependencies so will take a lot longer. However this will not happen next time.
