= Introduction =

Here you can find all the documentation about the restful interface PAT provides. If you feel that it should be altered or extended in anyway please file a change request, or ask nicely ;)


= Details =

PAT has generated a lot of interest from people wanting to integrate OLAP analysis into their applications but do not want to have to learn OLAP4J or want to use a different programming language. PAT hopes to bridge that gap by allowing users to most of the PAT functionality through a rest interface.

==Session==

Sadly currently PAT is not stateless, hopefully we can do something to rectify this in 2.0 but for now you need a session object to create a serverside session, this will be active by default for 30 minutes from the last moment of activity on the server.
