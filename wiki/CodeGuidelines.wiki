#summary Coding Guidelines

= Introduction =

We need to keep our code clean. To do so we have defined some coding guidelines, please follow them!

= Guidelines =

something like:

http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#codestyle

  * set up the elements of the widgets within the constructor.. and within the constructor call void methods that set up member variables
  * no strings in the code... width/height/whatever need to be defined as constants.. which are listed on the top of the class
  * extend from layoutcomposite instead of layoutpanel
  * clear widget / panel separation.. so you create your thing as widget (extend layoutcomposite) and if you want to use it.. you create a new panel(scrollpanel/popup/ whatever) and add the widget there
