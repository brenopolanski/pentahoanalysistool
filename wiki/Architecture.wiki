The PAT application is an assemblage of different layers and different frameworks. The front-end is generated by GWT. The back-end is Spring. The connection point between those two is the org.pentaho.pat.rpc package. It defines all the interfaces that the servlets expose to the GUI.

The main skeletton of the application is as follows :

  * org.pentaho.pat : This is the main package.
    * org.pentaho.pat.client : Everything related to GUI.
    * org.pentaho.pat.rpc : This is the RPC interfaces for client-server communications.
    * org.pentaho.pat.server : This is the main package of everything related to server stuff.
    * org.pentaho.pat.server.data : This is the persistence classes.
    * org.pentaho.pat.server.services : This is the service layer of the server.
    * org.pentaho.pat.server.servlet : This is the web layer of the server. It contains all the servlets that implement the RPC interfaces.
