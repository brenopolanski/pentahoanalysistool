#summary Goals of the Project

= Introduction =
These are the goals(so far) of the project and where we aim to be heading.


= Details =
==Stage 1==

  * Connectivity (XMLA or JDBC)
       * Register Cubes in Config
       * ( Cube Selection out of Config)

  * Working cube selection

  * Working Dim/Measure Selection

This will effectively get us back to where the idea branch ends, but with nice code and a proper design and layout.

==Stage 2==

  * Work on the Table decide which way to proced, GWT-EXT grid or other way.

  * Decide what features we want adding......

  * Loading the Table with MDX

  * Localization Support


==Stage 3==
  * Ability to work with both Drag and Drop Dimensions and pure MDX, and the ability for the Drag and Drop to update the MDX code.

  * Drill Down

  * Easy Cell Colour Coding

  * Dynamic Totals

==Planned Functionality==
  * Ability to be able to select individual properties instead of all or none(ask Daniel Einspanjer)

  * Phantal 2) Add some more ways of interacting directly with the crosstab table. For example, I'm constantly running into situations where I say "Alright, I'm only interested in this day", so I either need to modify the query to filter only for that day, or I have to drag'n drop all other days off the grid 

  * Phantal 3) I love the charting, but it'd be nice if they were more interactive, eg, the ability to drill down based on something visual. 

  * Phantal 4) The treemap would be cool if it actually worked. 

  * Phantal If it's ever made to function as a web applet or what-have-you, I'd really like to see hyperlinking capabilities added in 
  
  * Modular Pluggable Design

  * Implement interfaces (connectionstring, mdx statement, ...) that enables a call from a xaction like jpivot

  * Different Mode's (View only, user, admin)

  * New Calculated Measures via GUI

  * Save View as Xaction

  * Show single records

  * Export selection (including single records) (excel? html?)
